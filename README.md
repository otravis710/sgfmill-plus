# sgfmill-plus
A collection of functions built on top of the [sgfmill](https://pypi.org/project/sgfmill/)
library.

These functions are primarly tailored to my [independent research](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/Go+with+your+gutF+Determining+the+value+of+computation+in+the+game+of+Go%2C+Owen+Travis%2C+%2724+%282276037%29/1_f9vcoq7s/297780972) on Go, however, they may be useful
to anyone who is working with Smart Game Format (SGF) files.

`sgfmillplus.py` contains all of the functions in this library.

The `test-sgfs/` folder contains SGF files for testing. Descriptions
of these testing files can be found in `test-sgfs/_descriptions.md`.
