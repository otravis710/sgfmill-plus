# sgfmillplus
A collection of functions built on top of the [sgfmill](https://pypi.org/project/sgfmill/)
library.

These functions are primarly tailored to my [independent research](https://github.com/otravis710/GoMoveLocality) on Go, however, they may be useful
to anyone who is working with Smart Game Format (SGF) files.

`sgfmillplus.py` contains all of the functions in this library.

The `test-sgfs/` folder contains SGF files for testing. Descriptions
of these testing files can be found in `test-sgfs/_descriptions.md`.
